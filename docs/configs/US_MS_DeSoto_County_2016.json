The traditional approach for IO insertions in small patients - where the tibial tuberosity cannot be palpated - is to identify the insertion site - “TWO FINGER WIDTHS BELOW THE PATELLA and then medial along the flat aspect of the TIBIA.”</p><p>The traditional approach to IO insertion in slightly larger patients - where the tuberosity can be appreciated - generally suggests “One finger width distal to the tibial tuberosity along the flat aspect of the medial tibia.”</p><p>The EZ-IO should be inserted two finger widths bellow the patella (kneecap) and one finger medial (toward the inside) to the tibial tuberosity.</p><p>For the morbidly obese patient – consider rotating the foot to the mid-line position (foot straight up and down). With the knee slightly flexed, lift the foot off of the surface allowing the lower leg to “hang” dependent. This maneuver may improve your ability to visualize and access the tibial insertion site.</p><h3>Landmarks: Humeral Head</h3><p>Place the patient in a supine position.</p><p>Expose the shoulder and place the patient’s arm against the patient’s body.</p><p>Rest the elbow on the stretcher with the forearm on the abdomen. Palpate and identify the mid shaft humerus and continue palpating toward the humeral head. As you near the shoulder you will note a small protrusion. This is the base of the greater tubercle insertion site. With the opposite hand “pinch” the anterior and inferior aspects or the humeral head confirming the identification of the greater tubercle. This will ensure that you have identified the midline of the humerus itself. The insertion site is approximately two finger widths inferior to the coracoid process and the acromion.</p><h3>Landmarks: Medial Malleolus</h3><p>The insertion site is two finger widths proximal to the Medial Malleolus and positioned midline on the medial shaft</p><h3>Procedure:</h3><p>Inserting the EZ IO</p><ol><li>Determine that the EZ IO is indicated</li><li>Ensure that no contraindications are present.</li><li>Locate the proper insertion site.</li><li>Clean the insertion site with alcohol.</li><li>Prepare the EZ IO driver and needle set.</li><li>Stabilize the leg (or arm).</li><li>Position the driver at the insertion site with the needle at a 90 degree angle to the surface of the bone.</li><li>Power the needle set through the skin until you feel the tip of the needle set encounter the bone. Apply firm steady pressure on the driver and power through the cortex of the bone. Stop when the needle flange touches the skin or a sudden resistance is felt. Stop on the POP This indicates entry into the bone marrow cavity.</li><li>Grasp the hub firmly with one hand and remove the driver from the needle set.</li><li>While continuing to hold the hub firmly, rotate the stylet counter clockwise and remove it from the needle set. Dispose of the stylet properly in a sharps container.</li><li>Confirm proper placement of the EZ IO catheter tip:<ol type=\"a\"><li>The catheter stands straight up at a 90 degree angle and is firmly seated in the tibia.</li><li>Blood is sometimes visible at the tip of the stylet</li><li>Aspiration of a small amount of marrow with a syringe.</li></ol></li><li>Attach a primed extension set to the hub and flush the IO space with 10 cc of Normal Saline.</li></ol><h3>NO FLUSH – NO FLOW</h3><ol start=\"13\"><li>If the patient is conscious, administer lidocaine 2&#37; 20-50 mg slowly PRIOR to the initial bolus.</li><li>Initiate the infusion per standing orders.

However, implied consent only becomes legally effective after a reasonable effort is made under the circumstances to contact a parent or legal guardian to obtain their consent to treat the minor.</p><p>In non-emergent situations, \"mature\" minors are generally presumed to be legally competent to give consent. Whether or not a minor is \"mature\" depends upon multiple factors articulated by the Mississippi Supreme Court. Since it would be difficult, if not impossible, for an EMT or Paramedic to adequately assess the factors in the field, it is highly recommended that you obtain the consent of a parent or legal guardian before treating or transporting a non-emergent minor.</p><p>Obtaining the consent of a parent or legal guardian before treating or transporting a minor with either an emergent or non-emergent condition is usually not necessary when the minor is married or legally emancipated as married or emancipated minors are generally deemed to be legally competent.</p>"
